# Advent of Code 2018

Here are my solutions for [this year’s event](https://adventofcode.com/2018/). I’m going to start out using Racket again, although I might get lazy and switch to Python or quit entirely.

You can see the code in the `.rkt` files, or view my [tech notes for each day’s solutions](https://thenotepad.org/repos/aoc2018/timeline?y=e) ([RSS](https://thenotepad.org/repos/aoc2018/timeline.rss?y=e)).
